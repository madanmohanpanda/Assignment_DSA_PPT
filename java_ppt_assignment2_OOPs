Q1.Write a simple Banking System program by using OOPs concept where you can get account 
Holder name balance etc?
    

    class Bank{
        privet float balance;
        privet String name;
        public void deposite(int amount)
        {
            this.balance += amount;
        }
        public void setName(String name)
        {
            this.name = name;
        } 
        public void showBalance()
        {
            System.out.println("Yout balance is : "+balance);
        }
        public int withdraw(int amount)
        {
            if(this.balance > amount)
            {
                return amount;
            }
            System.out.println("You have not enough balance");
            return -1;
        }
    }

Q2. Write a Program where you inherit method from parent class and show method Overridden Concept?

    class Vehicle{
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.printn("can run");
        }
    }

    class Bike extends vehicle{
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.println("run by two wheel");
        }
    }

    class Test{
        public static void main(String[] a)
        {
            Vehicle v =new vehicle();
            v.run(); // can run
            Bike b  = new Bike();
            b.run(); // run by two wheel
        }
    }

Q3.Write a program to show run time polymorphism in java?
   class Vehicle{
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.printn("can run");
        }
    }

    class Bike extends vehicle{
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.println("run by two wheel");
        }
    }

    class Test{
        public void test(Vehicle v)
        {
            v.run();
        }
        public static void main(String[] a)
        {
            Test t = new Test();
            Vehicle v =new Bike();

            t.test(v); // run by two wheel
            
        }
    }
Q4.Write a program to show Compile time polymorphism in java?

    class Vehicle{
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.printn("can run");
        }
        public void run(int x)
        {
            System.out.printn("can run by "+x+" wheel");
        }
    }
 
    class Test{
     
        public static void main(String[] a)
        {
            
            Vehicle v =new Vehicle();

            v.run(2); // can run by 2 wheel
            
        }
    }

Q6. What is the benefit of encapsulation in java?

    i. Better control.
    ii. getter and setter
    iii. Security
    iv. Flexibility
    v. data hiding

Q7.Is java a t 100% Object oriented Programming language? If no why ?

    Java is not 100% Object oriented Programming language because it does not
    support multiple inheritance.

Q8.What are the advantages of abstraction in java?

    i. Hiding useless information
    ii. generalizing 

Q9.What is an abstraction explained with an Example?

    abstraction is a concept to showing essential information and hiding the internal 
    complexity.

    abstact class Test {
        abstact public void run();
    }

    class T extends Test{
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.print("PW SKILLS");
        }
    }

    we cannot create the Test class object rather we create the T class object.

Q10.What is the final class in Java?

    We can not extend any final class.

    final calss does not have abstact method
