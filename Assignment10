Q1. What is the Spring MVC framework?

Spring MVC is a web framework provided by the Spring Framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
architectural pattern. It provides a structured approach to building web applications by separating concerns into 
distinct components, making development more organized and modular.

Q2. What are the benefits of Spring MVC framework over other MVC frameworks?

Some benefits of Spring MVC over other MVC frameworks include:
- Integration with other Spring modules and features.
- Support for Dependency Injection and aspect-oriented programming.
- Seamless integration with other Java EE technologies.
- Flexible and customizable architecture.
- Strong community support and active development.
- Extensive testing support and mock object integration.
- Built-in support for internationalization and validation.
- Easy integration with other web technologies and frameworks.

Q3. What is DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC? In other words, can you explain the Spring MVC architecture?

The DispatcherServlet is the central component in the Spring MVC architecture. It acts as the front controller, 
receiving incoming HTTP requests and dispatching them to the appropriate handler (controller) based on URL 
mappings and configuration. The DispatcherServlet coordinates the flow of the request, handling the processing, 
and returning the appropriate response. It works with other components like HandlerMapping, HandlerAdapter, and 
ViewResolver to handle the entire request-response lifecycle.

Q4. What is a View Resolver pattern and explain its significance in Spring MVC?


The View Resolver pattern in Spring MVC is responsible for resolving logical view names returned by the controller 
into actual view resources that will be rendered to the client. It decouples the controller from the specific view 
technology and allows for easy switching between different view technologies (JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.) without 
affecting the controller code. The View Resolver pattern simplifies the configuration and management of views in 
Spring MVC applications.

Q5. What are the differences between @RequestParam and @PathVariable annotations?


- @RequestParam is used to bind individual request parameters from the query string or form data, while 
@PathVariable is used to bind variables from the path of the URL. @RequestParam is used with a parameter name, 
while @PathVariable is used with a placeholder in the URL.

- @RequestParam is optional by default, while @PathVariable is required by default.

- @RequestParam can handle multiple parameters with the same name, while @PathVariable can only handle a single 
value from the path.
- @RequestParam provides default values and supports optional parameters, while @PathVariable does not have such 
features.

Q6. What is the Model in Spring MVC?

The Model in Spring MVC represents the data or information that is used by the view for rendering. It encapsulates 
the application's data and state. The Model can include business objects, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), or any 
other data required by the view. The Model is populated by the controller and then passed to the view for 
presentation.

Q7. What is the role of @ModelAttribute annotation?

The @ModelAttribute annotation in Spring MVC is used to bind request parameters or form data to model attributes. 
It can be applied at the method level or parameter level. At the method level, it is used to add common attributes 
to the model for multiple requests. At the parameter level, it binds a specific request parameter to a method 
parameter or model attribute.

Q8. What is the significance of @Repository annotation?

The @Repository annotation in Spring is used to indicate that a class is a repository or data access component. It 
serves as a specialization of the @Component annotation and is typically applied to classes that interact with a 
database, perform data access operations, or provide data persistence functionality. The @Repository annotation 
helps with automatic bean detection and provides meaningful metadata to the Spring container.

Q9. What does REST stand for? and what are RESTful web services?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is an architectural style and set of principles for 
designing networked applications. RESTful web services are web services that adhere to the principles of REST. 
They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for data manipulation and follow the concept of resources 
that can be identified by unique URLs. RESTful web services provide a lightweight, scalable, and stateless 
approach for building distributed systems.

Q10. What are the differences between RESTful web services and SOAP web services?

Some differences between RESTful web services and SOAP web services include:
- Communication: RESTful web services use simple HTTP protocols, while SOAP web services use XML-based protocols 
over various transport protocols.
- Data Format: RESTful web services commonly use lightweight data formats such as JSON or XML, while SOAP web 
services primarily use XML for data exchange.
- Service Definition: RESTful web services typically have no strict contract definition, while SOAP web services 
rely on WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for contract definition.
- Statefulness: RESTful web services are stateless, meaning they do not maintain session state, while SOAP web 
services can maintain session state.
- Flexibility: RESTful web services are more flexible, allowing easier integration with different platforms and 
technologies, while SOAP web services provide better support for enterprise-level features like security and 
transactions.
